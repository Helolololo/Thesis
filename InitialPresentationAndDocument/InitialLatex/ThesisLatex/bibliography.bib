  abstract = {The recent digitalization of manufacturing companies, driven by "Industry 4.0" guidelines, introduces a series of challenges and opportunities both for enterprise and research environments. In this perspective, a debated subject is the interfacing of hardware, because logistic challenges and production assets are moving towards the adoption of Internet-of-Things-based CyberPhysical Systems (CPS), whose flexibility allows to rethink control architectures that are traditionally based on ISA 95 and IEC 62264 formalized hierarchies. More versatile architectures also pave the way to the so-called horizontal integration. This work focuses on intra-logistics, aiming at defining a simple architecture enabling CPS assets' monitoring and control. This allows the development of an open platform that enables an easy and simultaneous connection of multi-vendor hardware, overcoming the current legacy systems’ gap of requiring a significant effort to do so. The architecture is then substantiated by the development of a component interfacing Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) and managing their navigation thanks to a Fleet Management System (FMS), which is back fed by the same AGVs.},

  abstract = {The fundamental difference between autonomous robotic assembly and traditional hard automation, currently utilized in large-scale manufacturing production, lies in the speciﬁc approaches used in locating, acquiring, manipulating, aligning, and assembling parts. An autonomous robotic assembly manipulator offers high ﬂexibility and high capability to deal with the inherent system uncertainties, unknowns, and exceptions. This paper presents an autonomous mobile manipulator that effectively overcomes inherent system uncertainties and exceptions by utilizing control strategies that employ coordinated control, combine visual and force servoing, and incorporate sophisticated reactive task control. The mobile manipulation system has been demonstrated experimentally to achieve high reliability for a “pegin-hole” type of insertion assembly task that is commonly encountered in automotive wiring harness assembly.},

  abstract   = {Robotics and related technologies are central to the ongoing digitization and advancement of manufacturing. In recent years, a variety of strategic initiatives around the world including "Industry 4.0", introduced in Germany in 2011 have aimed to improve and connect manufacturing technologies in order to optimize production processes. In this work, we study the changing technological landscape of robotics and "internet-of-things" (IoT)-based connective technologies over the last 7-10 years in the wake of Industry 4.0. We interviewed key players within the European robotics ecosystem, including robotics manufacturers and integrators, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and applied industrial research institutions and synthesize our findings in this paper. We first detail the state-of-the-art robotics and IoT technologies we observed and that the companies discussed during our interviews. We then describe the processes the companies follow when deciding whether and how to integrate new technologies, the challenges they face when integrating these technologies, and some immediate future technological avenues they are exploring in robotics and IoT. Finally, based on our findings, we highlight key research directions for the robotics community that can enable improved capabilities in the context of manufacturing.},
